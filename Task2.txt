
For detect objects in TensorFlow we have ability to program an external memory that
contains all the necessary features to recognize things. This memory automatically
activates once it is confirmed and a connection is established between the memory
and the robot. Since the robot has a camera and sensors, it becomes easy for the 
robot to clearly recognize things based on what it sees. The presence of a vast
library with millions of stored items further simplifies the robot's ability to
recognize things easily.
